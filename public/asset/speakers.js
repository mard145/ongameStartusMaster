		"about": "Hello, my name is Jesse Freeman and I am a Technology Evangelist at Microsoft focusing on Windows 8 and HTML5 Gaming. My job is to help developers build amazing apps and games for Windows 8. I have been a Web developer for over 13 years as well as a mobile app developer for the better part of the last 4 years. I moved back to NY in 2002 and have worked with some of the city's top companies such as MLB, the New York Jets, HBO, Tommy Hilfiger, Bloomberg and even internationally for clients such as VW. Through my career I have seen all sides of development from independent contractor, government, consultant, agency and product. It has been a crazy ride and an amazing one that helped make me the developer I am today. In addition to my client work I have also been a speaker, author and blogger for the past 6 years. Through all of my work I have always had a passion for making games and over the past year I have been focusing on HTML5 game development. I recently wrote a book for O'Reilly called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-HTML5-Development-Jesse-Freeman/dp/1449315178' target='_blank'>Introducing HTML5 Game Development</a> using the ImpactJS framework. I have always used my passion for making games to help me learn new programing languages and this passion is one thing I hope to help share with others.
